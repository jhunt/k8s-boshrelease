description: |
  An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that
  containers are running in a pod.

  The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various
  mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are
  running and healthy. The kubelet doesn’t manage containers which were not
  created by Kubernetes.
