description: |
  The Kubernetes control plane, minus the etcd storage backend.
  The control plane is designed to scale horizontally – that is, it scales
  by deploying more instances.

  This includes the following components:

    - Kubernetes API Server (kube-apiserver)
    - Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)
    - Scheduler (kube-scheduler)

  The Controller Manager runs controllers.
  Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce
  complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single
  process.

  These controllers include:

    - Node Controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go
      down.

    - Replication Controller: Responsible for maintaining the correct number
      of pods for every replication controller object in the system.

    - Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins
      Services & Pods).

    - Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API
      access tokens for new namespaces.

  The Scheduler watches newly created pods that have no node
  assigned, and selects a node for them to run on.

  Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include individual and
  collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints,
  affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload
  interference and deadlines.

  cluster.name:
    description: |
      The name of this cluster.  Cluster names should be lower case, and may
      only consist of alphanumeric characters, periods (.), hyphens (-) and
      underscores (_).  They must start with a letter.
    default: my-unnamed-k8s-cluster

  cluster.ip:
    description: A public IP for this cluster, for routing internal traffic.
    default: ''

  coalesce:
    description: How long (in seconds) to wait for the Kubernetes cluster to coalesce into a functioning unit.
    default: 300

  encryption.key:
    description: A random key to use for encrypting secrets and other data at-rest.

  networks.services:
    description: |
      Network CIDR range to use for Service IP allocation.
      This must NOT overlap with networks.pods.

  networks.pods:
    description: |
      Network CIDR range to use for Pod IP allocation.
      This must NOT overlap with networks.services.

  networks.nodes:
    description: |
      Network CIDR range that the Kubernetes nodes use.

  images.kube-proxy:
    description: |
      Where to pull the k8s BOSH release Docker image for kube-proxy.
      If you need to run in an air-gapped network, or just want to inspect the contents
      of your components manually, you can rebuild this image and push it into a private
      registry.
    default: docker.io/huntprod/k8s-bosh-kube-proxy:1.12.0

  tls.ca.certificate:
    description: |
      The X.509 Certificate Authority's certificate, in PEM format.

      This certificate must be valid for the following key usages:
        - Digital Signing
        - Key Encipherment
        - Server Auth (Extended)
        - Client Auth (Extended)

  tls.ca.key:
    description: |
      The X.509 Certificate Authority's RSA private key, in PEM format.

      The signing key is necessary to auto-enroll k8s nodes (the `kubelet`
      job, in this BOSH release) in properly validated mutual TLS setups.

  tls.sa.certificate:
    description: |
      An X.509 certificate in PEM format.

      This certificate is used by the Kubernetes apiserver component to validate
      Bearer tokens generated using the corresponding private key (tls.sa.key),
      by the controller-manager.

      It does not participate in PKI, or mutual TLS, and therefore does not
      have any specific CN / SAN requirements, and need not be signed by any
      Certificate Authority.

  tls.sa.key:
    description: |
      An RSA private key, in PEM format.

      This key is used by the controller-manager to sign generated Bearer tokens,
      so that the apiserver can validate them (using tls.sa.certificate).
